a)backend
type Backend struct {
	Url   *url.URL
	Alive bool
	Mux   sync.Mutex

	Reverse_proxy *httputil.ReverseProxy
}
b)serverpool
type Serverpool struct {
	Backend []*Backend
	Mux     sync.Mutex
	Current int
}

//func Getnextpeer() {
	this func increase the Current by + using modulo as the current should not go out of index then the slice of the backend 

}
//func pingserver(){
  this func ping the the backend to this is func is to be used indise the headlth check so that we can monitor the Alive
  satus of the backend 
  this ping out the server every 500ms 

}

//func healthcheck(){
	this func inheirat the pool *serverpool.backend (slice) 
	this is an goroutine which is fired every 500ms(but for simility we keep it sleep or 5*time.second)
	so that all fuck offf
}



//routes
the entry point is set at :4000 and after that we use a LBhandler
LBhandler handles the request using round robin for which it uses helper func getnextpeer as well as healthcheck
so that all fuck off


//backend ports 
currently active :8000 and :8081
